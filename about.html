        What drives our faculty, students, and staff is a spirit of possibility, a legacy inherited from our pioneering founders who created Stanford in the memory of their only child to benefit other people’s children. At Stanford, we learn from our past but focus on the future, continually looking for new ways to make the world a better place.

        We believe strongly in the role that higher education plays in supporting a thriving society. Colleges and universities not only prepare students for their chosen path, but they help create the next generation of citizen leaders and problem solvers. Higher education institutions pursue a distinct and enduring mission in our society, dedicated solely to the creation and dissemination of knowledge. The breadth and richness of the fabric that comprises the world’s institutions of higher learning are integral to long-term human advancement and well-being.
